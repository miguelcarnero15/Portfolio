            I am based out of Flordia. I have just
            recently started to go down the path of becoming a Web Developer 
            and I am so excited to keep learning and growing in this every lasting 
            carrer. I currrently have had no knowlege about any of this leading up to where I am right now
            I work at UPS where I have for the better part of 3 years so this is something that is way out of my scope.
            But in seeing how ever lasting this is I realized that there is no better time than now to get into the 
            industry. I am a hard worker and I love to solve a problem to the best of my ability.
